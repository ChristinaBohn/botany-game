## What I Learned
I'm learning in this project that it is better to code line by line, testing each small function as you add on, so that it is easier to spot mistakes or fix bugs as they come up. Writing larger chunks of code at a time that you think is right leaves a lot of connected pieces to try to untangle when trying to figure out why one thing doesn't work.
